Removing unused or suspicious extensions can help safeguard privacy and improve browser performance. Extensions with broad permissions (like reading all cookies or monitoring web traffic) should be reviewed critically, as they can present security risks if malicious or compromised.

The screenshot shows the browser extensions manager with four installed extensions:

Check US Visa Slots - USVisaScheduling

Purpose: Allows you to check and share US visa slot availability.

Permissions: Access to visa slot information via checkvisaslots.com.


Cookie-Editor

Purpose: Enables quick creation, editing, and deletion of browser cookies without leaving your tab.

Permissions: Manages cookies.


Google Docs Offline

Purpose: Lets you edit, create, and view Google documents, spreadsheets, and presentations without internet access.

Permissions: Access Google Docs functionality offline.


McAfee® WebAdvisor

Purpose: Provides browsing protection and security assistance.

Permissions: Varies, but can include checking links and monitoring web traffic.



Steps I Took to Review and Remove Browser Extensions

Opened my browser’s extensions/add‑ons manager.

Reviewed all installed extensions:

           Check US Visa Slots – USVisaScheduling

           Cookie‑Editor

           Google Docs Offline

           McAfee® WebAdvisor

Checked permissions for each extension, focusing on those that could access browsing data or cookies.

Identified that Cookie‑Editor and Check US Visa Slots were no longer essential and had permissions I didn’t need.

Removed both Cookie‑Editor and Check US Visa Slots – USVisaScheduling extensions.

Restarted my browser to apply the changes.

Observed a slight improvement in browser performance and responsiveness.

Researched how malicious extensions can harm users (e.g., data theft, tracking, injecting ads).

Documented the steps taken, the extensions removed, and the improvements noticed.


Research how malicious extensions can harm users. 

Malicious browser extensions can seriously harm users by exploiting the permissions they are granted to compromise security and privacy. Here are key ways they cause harm:

Excessive Permissions Abuse: Malicious extensions often request broad permissions to access all browsing data, emails, clipboard content, and saved credentials. This can lead to unauthorized data collection and monitoring of user behavior, exposing sensitive personal or business information.

Malicious Code Injection: They can inject harmful scripts into webpages the user visits, enabling attacks like credential harvesting, session hijacking, or redirecting users to phishing websites.

Data Exfiltration & Privacy Invasion: These extensions can covertly collect and transmit browsing history, login credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive data to attackers, often without user knowledge, resulting in data breaches and privacy violations.

Session Hijacking & Man-in-the-Browser Attacks: By intercepting session tokens or form data, they can impersonate users to access secure sites or manipulate transactions in real-time, especially dangerous for online banking or shopping.

Keylogging and Monitoring: Some extensions record keyboard inputs to capture passwords, credit card numbers, and private communications, leading to identity theft and account compromise.

Malware and Adware Installation: They may install malware or adware that can degrade system performance, display unwanted ads, or open doors for further attacks.

Operational Disruptions and Compliance Risks: Malicious extensions can cause productivity loss, regulatory violations, and reputational damage, particularly in enterprise environments where sensitive data is at stake.

Hard to Detect: Because extensions run within browsers and don’t generate traditional process alerts, malicious activity can go unnoticed for long periods, making them a stealthy threat.
